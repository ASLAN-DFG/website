## Project Overview

The project ASLAN introduces a **human-in-the-loop** paradigm for scoring free-text lerner answers in education. 
By leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) and advanced text normalization, the project aims to reduce the linguistic variance of student answers. 
Instead of fully automating the grading process - which often faces challenges regarding transparency, ethics, and accuracy - this approach uses Machine Learning to normalize and cluster answers, allowing human teachers to grade more efficiently without losing control over the final assessment. 
In this way, we aim for easier adaptation to new tasks and a significant reduction in the workload of teachers dealing with time-consuming assessment tasks.</p>

### Research objectives
The main objective is to investigate an alternative assessment model for free-text tasks based on supporting manual evaluation through text normalization, enabling fine-grained feedback. To achieve this, the project addresses several specific research objectives:
- **Performance Analysis:** Evaluate how the proposed approach influences the accuracy and time requirements of assessments compared to conventional human scoring on one hand and a fully automated scoring model on the other.
- **Methodological Suitability:**  Investigate which existing text normalization approaches can be applied to learner responses, identifying where adaptations are necessary or where entirely new methods must be developed.
- **Cross-Lingual Transfer:** Explore how existing approaches developed for other languages (primarily English, e.g., the resolution of numerical expressions) can be effectively transferred to German.
- **Process Optimization:** Determine the role and impact of the sequence of normalization steps on the overall quality of the results.
- **Bias and Robustness:** Analyze which biases are introduced or amplified by the normalization process and assess the system's vulnerability to adversarial inputs.
